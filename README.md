### Repository Overview

This repository serves as a central location for specific manuscripts for the VCU Forest Ecology Lab at Virginia Commonwealth University (Dr. Christopher M. Gough, PI), as such, DOIs will be minted following the addition of each manuscript and the supporting code and data that is added to this repository. Additionaly, the minor version number (0.x.0) will also be updated. This readme will serve as a general guide until vignettes and supporting documentation are added. 

The general structure of this repo is that all data, code, and text for each manuscript is contained with in the `/manuscripts` folder within a unique and distinct subfolder. Unless copyright law specficially restrict it, manuscript text will be included therein as well.

#### Diversity, structure and complexity as predictors of carbon cycling resistance to disturbance
*This paper is currently in review*

The pre-disturbance vegetation characteristics that confer carbon (C) cycling resistance to disturbance are not well known. To address this gap, we initiated the Forest Resilience Threshold Experiment (FoRTE), a manipulative study comprised of factorial combinations of four levels of (control, 45%, 65% and 85% gross defoliation) disturbance severity and two disturbance types (targeting upper or lower canopy strata) replicated within four landscape ecosystem types. Applying a standardized stability framework, we investigated to what extent pre-disturbance levels of species diversity, aboveground woody biomass, leaf area index, and canopy rugosity – a measure of structural complexity – predict initial responses (i.e., resistance) of subcanopy light-saturated leaf CO2 assimilation (Asat), aboveground wood NPP (ANPPw) and soil respiration (Rs) to disturbance. Calculating resistance as the first-year natural log response ratio of disturbance and control treatments, we found that above-ground C cycling processes, Asat and ANPPw, were resistant to increases in disturbance severity, while Rs resistance declined as severity increased. Disturbance type had no effect on resistance. Pre-disturbance aboveground woody biomass was a positive predictor of ANPPw resistance and, along with canopy rugosity, was related negatively to Rs resistance. Subcanopy Asat resistance was not consistently dependent upon pre-disturbance ecosystem properties. Stability of C uptake processes along with Rs declines suggest the net C balance was sustained in the initial months following disturbance. We conclude that biomass and complexity are significant, but not universal, predictors of C cycling resistance to disturbance. Our findings also highlight the utility of standardized stability measures when comparing functional responses to disturbance.

####  Community and structural constraints on the complexity of eastern North American forests

*This paper has been accepted at Global Ecology and Biogeography*
“Laserquest” investigators use remote sensing to advance understanding of ecosystem structure-function relationships across spatial scales, from the eco- to macrosystem. The extended research team includes physiological, community, ecosystem ecologists, carbon cycling scientists, applied forest ecologists, remote sensing scientists, and ecosystem and earth system modelers. Through partnerships with observing networks such as NEON and Ameriflux, and using novel ecological observations obtained with the aid of new technologies, Laserquest researchers seek to improve model representation of ecosystem structure.
