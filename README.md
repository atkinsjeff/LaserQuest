### Repository Overview

This repository serves as a central location for specific manuscripts for the VCU Forest Ecology Lab at Virginia Commonwealth University (Dr. Christopher M. Gough, PI), as such, DOIs will be minted following the addition of each manuscript and the supporting code and data that is added to this repository. Additionaly, the minor version number (0.x.0) will also be updated. This readme will serve as a general guide until vignettes and supporting documentation are added. 

The general structure of this repo is that all data, code, and text for each manuscript is contained with in the `/manuscripts` folder within a unique and distinct subfolder. Unless copyright law specficially restrict it, manuscript text will be included therein as well.

### Abstract

The pre-disturbance vegetation characteristics that confer initial carbon (C) cycling resistance to disturbance are not well known. To address this gap, we initiated the Forest Resilience Threshold Experiment (FoRTE), a manipulative study comprised of replicated factorial combinations of four levels (control, 45%, 65% and 85% gross defoliation) of disturbance severity and two disturbance types (targeting upper or lower canopy strata) implemented by stem girdling >3600 trees. Applying a standardized stability framework in which resistance was calculated as the first-year natural log response ratio of disturbance and control treatments, we investigated to what extent pre-disturbance levels of species diversity, aboveground woody biomass, leaf area index, and canopy rugosity – a measure of structural complexity – predict the initial resistance of subcanopy light-saturated leaf CO~2~ assimilation (A~sat~), aboveground wood NPP (ANPP~w~) and soil respiration (R~s~) to phloem-disrupting disturbance. We found that above-ground C cycling processes, A~sat~ and ANPP~w~, were highly resistant to increases in disturbance severity, while Rs resistance declined as severity increased. Disturbance type had no effect on first-year resistance. Pre-disturbance aboveground woody biomass was a positive predictor of ANPP~w~ resistance and, along with canopy rugosity, was negatively related to R~s~ resistance. Subcanopy A~sat~ resistance was not related to pre-disturbance vegetation characteristics. Stability of C uptake processes along with Rs declines suggest the net C sink was sustained in the initial months following disturbance. We conclude that biomass and complexity are significant, but not universal, predictors of initial C cycling resistance to disturbance. Our findings highlight the utility of standardized stability measures when comparing functional responses to disturbance.

“Laserquest” investigators use remote sensing to advance understanding of ecosystem structure-function relationships across spatial scales, from the eco- to macrosystem. The extended research team includes physiological, community, ecosystem ecologists, carbon cycling scientists, applied forest ecologists, remote sensing scientists, and ecosystem and earth system modelers. Through partnerships with observing networks such as NEON and Ameriflux, and using novel ecological observations obtained with the aid of new technologies, Laserquest researchers seek to improve model representation of ecosystem structure.
