## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r data.import}
df <- read.csv("./data/forte_resistance_data_yr_one.csv")

# change severity from integer to factor
df$severity <-as.factor(df$severity)
```

### Question One: Do key carbon cycling processes respond similarly to disturbance?

```{r question.one}
df %>%
  select(rep, severity, type, rNPP, rRs, rAmax) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(rNPP, rRs, rAmax),
               values_to = "resistance") -> df.resist


# GLM model
# original SAS code:
# proc sort; by funct; run;
# proc glm;
# class rep sev trt funct;
# model R = rep sev trt;
# means sev/lsd alpha = 0.1; by funct;
# run;

resist.model <- lm(resistance ~ rep + severity + type, data = df.resist)
summary(resist.model)

```
## Q2: Does carbon cycling process resistance change as a function of disturbance severity and canopy strata affected?

## Q3: Do pre-disturbance canopy structural complexity and LAI affect carbon cycling process resistances?
```{r samp.var}

# Let's look at means of variables
df %>%
  select(-type) %>%
  group_by(rep, severity) %>%
  dplyr::summarize_all(list(~mean(.), ~var(.))) -> df.means.var

knitr::kable(df.means.var[,c(1:2, 3:10)], caption = "Variable means for year 2019") %>%
  kable_styling() 

knitr::kable(df.means.var[,c(1:2, 11:18)], caption = "Variable variance for year 2019") %>%
  kable_styling() 
  
```

Next...Testing LAI and resistance

```{r rugosity}
# sas code:  
# proc glm data=resist2;
# class severity;
# model rNPP rRs rAmax = rugosity rugosity*severity;
# run;

# R version of the SAS GLM 

# NPP resistance
lm.rNPP <- lm(rNPP ~ rugosity + rugosity*severity, data = df)
summary(lm.rNPP)

# Soil Respiration (Rs) resistance
lm.rRs <- lm(rRs ~ rugosity + rugosity*severity, data = df)
summary(lm.rRs)

# Amax resistance
lm.rAmax <- lm(rAmax ~ rugosity + rugosity*severity, data = df)
summary(lm.rAmax)
```

Next...Testing structural (rugosity) and resistance

```{r LAI}
# sas code:  
# proc glm;
# class severity;
# model rNPP rRs rAmax = LAI LAI*severity;
# run;


# R version of the SAS GLM 

# NPP resistance
lm.rNPP.LAI <- lm(rNPP ~ LAI + LAI*severity, data = df)
summary(lm.rNPP.LAI)

# Soil Respiration (Rs) resistance
lm.rRs.LAI <- lm(rRs ~ LAI + LAI*severity, data = df)
summary(lm.rRs.LAI)

# Amax resistance
lm.rAmax.LAI <- lm(rAmax ~ LAI + LAI*severity, data = df)
summary(lm.rAmax.LAI)
```



```{r biomass}
# sas code:  
# proc glm;
# class severity;
# model rNPP rRs rAmax = biomass biomass*severity;
# run;


# R version of the SAS GLM 

# NPP resistance
lm.rNPP.biomass <- lm(rNPP ~ biomass + biomass*severity, data = df)
summary(lm.rNPP.biomass)

# Soil Respiration (Rs) resistance
lm.rRs.biomass <- lm(rRs ~ biomass + biomass*severity, data = df)
summary(lm.rRs.biomass)

# Amax resistance
lm.rAmax.biomass <- lm(rAmax ~ biomass + biomass*severity, data = df)
summary(lm.rAmax.biomass)
```


```{r shannon}
# sas code:  
# proc glm;
# class severity;
# model rNPP rRs rAmax = shannon shannon*severity;
# run;


message("Testing")
# R version of the SAS GLM 

# NPP resistance
lm.rNPP.shannon <- lm(rNPP ~ shannon + shannon*severity, data = df)
summary(lm.rNPP.shannon)

# Soil Respiration (Rs) resistance
lm.rRs.shannon <- lm(rRs ~ shannon + shannon*severity, data = df)
summary(lm.rRs.shannon)

# Amax resistance
lm.rAmax.shannon <- lm(rAmax ~ shannon + shannon*severity, data = df)
summary(lm.rAmax.shannon)
```
